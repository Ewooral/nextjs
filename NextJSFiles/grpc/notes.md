# gRPC

- is a free open source framework developed by Google
- is part of the cloud native computation foundation (CNFC) - like Docker and kubernetes
- at high level, it allows you to define REQUEST and RESPONSE for RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)
  and handles all the rest for you
- On top of it, it's modern, `fast` and `efficient`, build on top of `HTTP/2`,
  `low latency`, supports `streaming`, language independent, and makes it super
  easy to plug in `authentication`, load balancing, logging and monitoring.
