# DESIGNING HTML LAYOUTS
When designing layouts in HTML, there are several tags that are particularly useful:

<div>: This is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements. It's very useful for creating sections of your layout.

<span>: This is an inline element that is often used to style a section of text within a block-level element.

<section>: This is a semantic element used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.

<header> and <footer>: These semantic elements are used to contain introductory and concluding information. Typically, a <header> might contain a logo, navigation, and a title. A <footer> might contain contact information, a copyright notice, and links to terms of service.

<nav>: This semantic element is used to contain navigation links.

<main>: This semantic element is used to contain the main unique content of a document, and there should be only one per page.

<aside>: This semantic element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it, and could be considered separate.

<article>: This semantic element is used to contain a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.

<figure> and <figcaption>: These semantic elements are used to associate a caption with an image, diagram, or code snippet.

Grid elements (<grid>, <grid-row>, <grid-column>): These are not standard HTML elements, but are often used in CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to create grid-based layouts.
