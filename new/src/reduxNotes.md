some important key terms in Redux:

1. Store: It holds the application state and allows access to it.

2. Action: It describes an event that triggers a state change. It is an 
   object with a type property.

3. Reducer: It is a pure function that takes the current state and an 
   action as input and returns a new state. It specifies how the state 
   should change based on the action type.

4. Dispatch: It is a function used to send an action to the store. It is 
   the only way to update the state.

5. Middleware: It is a function that sits between the dispatch and the reducer. 
   It allows you to modify or intercept actions before they reach the reducer.

6. Selector: It is a function used to extract and compute derived state from the Redux store.

7. Immutable: Redux encourages immutability, meaning the state should not be directly mutated. Instead, new copies of the state should be created when making changes.

These are some of the important key terms in Redux. 


# VERY BASIC EXPLANATION OF REDUX
Imagine you have a toy box called the Redux store. Inside the toy box, you have all your toys, which represent the application state. Now, let's say you want to play with a specific toy, but you can't directly take it out of the toy box.

Instead, you have to use a special paper called an action. This paper describes what toy you want to play with and how you want to play with it. For example, the action might say, "I want to play with the red car by driving it forward."

Now, you need someone called a reducer to read the action and decide how to change the toy box. The reducer is like a smart helper who knows how to handle different actions. It looks at the action and decides what to do with the toy box based on the instructions.

Once the reducer figures out what to do, it takes a new piece of paper and writes down the updated state of the toy box. This updated state represents the changes made by playing with the toy. The reducer then puts this paper back into the toy box.

Now, you can look into the toy box and see the new state of your toys! You can see how playing with the red car made it move forward.

To make all this happen, you need to use a special function called dispatch. It's like a messenger that takes your action paper and sends it to the reducer. The reducer reads the action, makes the changes, and gives you back the updated state.

That's how Redux works in simple terms! It helps you manage and update the state of your application using actions, reducers, and a store (the toy box).
